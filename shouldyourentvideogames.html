<p>First off, let's clarify something. Concerning the broad term video games, it should be understood that in this context it references all videogames played on a console. That means not including computer games, and games that are played on mobile devices like phones and tablets.</p><p>That being said, there are many schools of thought when it comes to the pros and cons of renting versus buying videogames. Generally the more serious gamer and collector will opt to purchase games so they own them and can display them. Conversely, renters don't often have a large collection to display, but they also have at their disposal vast libraries of games on many different systems, and more often then not, it is a much larger selection than even the most serious collectors can amass.</p>There is something to be said for owning your own games, but there is also something to be said for having a large selection available. Take spotify or apple music as an example. These great distributors of music offer tens of millions of songs at about the equivalent cost of buying an album per month. If you were to instead spend that money on purchasing a physical album every month, in a lifetime of collecting, you would still be nowhere close to having all the music that these large companies can offer.<p><p>The same is true with other services like Netflix, Hulu, etc.. We often subscribe to make recurring payments for various forms of entertainment like music and movies, but do not often think of videogames in the same way. Videogames are a form of entertainment. Some people may spend more time playing videogames than watching TV. That person may find a game rental subscription to be more valuable than a Netflix subscription.</p><p>Aside from that one example just given, there are many great reasons to choose to rent videogames. It may be cheaper than buying all the games you would regularly buy in a year. In the case of sports games, if you can have quick access, you won't have to make a $60 purchase just to play the most recent sports games before they become irrelevant and the next years edition is already out. If you play through games quickly you can also save money by renting.</p><p>There are also many good reasons to purchase games. To collect them, to always have access, and to never be bound to a subscription. We have considered all of these aspects in our rental <a href="calculator.html">calculator</a>, and hope you can figure out what works best for you!</p>
