  <p>You're probably wondering why we created this site. Here's the bottom line. We love videogames and we love saving money. Video games are a form of entertainment. Many of us spend a lot of money purchasing videogames and we also spend a lot of time enjoying them. We've all asked ourselves, "Should I buy this particular game at full price? Or should I wait awhile until it gets more affordable?". As we considered how often we wonder this exact thing, we also started to wonder what the most affordable way is to enjoy videogames. </p><p>We've come to the conclusion that it makes sense for a lot of people to rent video games. Often, we are excited by an upcoming title and await it's arrival anxiously. We preorder the game, it arrives, and then 2 weeks later, it's completed and we never go back to it again. This raises so many questions. Why did you buy it if you never intend to replay? Would it have been worth your while just to rent it and return it? These are the kinds of questions we want to help you answer as you navigate this site. We recommend you first check out <a href="shouldyourentvideogames.html">this page</a> to see the pros and cons of renting vs. buying your videogames. Then, head on over to the <a href="calculator">calculator</a> and see if renting is really right for you! We love your suggestions and hope that you will contact us with any new ideas or insights about buying and renting games, as well as any ideas you have to make this site better. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
